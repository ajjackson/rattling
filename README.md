rattling
--------

This repository is intended to contain tools for producing
"phonon-rattled" atomistic structures, that go further than functionality
included with the
[Atomic Simulation Environment](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/index.html) (ASE) and
[hiphive](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/index.html).

We are particularly interested in mode-selective sampling for the
simulation of EELS.

At this stage, code resides in a single script "demo.py".
